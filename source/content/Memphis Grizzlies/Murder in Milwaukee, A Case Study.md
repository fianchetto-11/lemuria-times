Ja Morant and the Grizzlies made it look easy against the Bucks. Everything was working for them, but I wanted to highlight some of these nice pick and roll reads Morant makes throughout the night while en route to his 26pt/10reb/14ast this game.

>[!example] Drop Attempt 001
Our first clip comes a little over two minutes into the game. Zach Edey sets the pick for Ja Morant while Gary Trent Jr. comes up over the screen and Brook Lopez sits in drop coverage. Ja gets Lopez moving to defend the rim and with a nice dribble opens up space for an easy 10' bucket.

>[!example] Drop Attempt 002
Moments later in game, these exact four players find themselves in the same situation. The memory of getting scored on still fresh in his mind, Lopez now does not drop all the way back to the rim but rather steps into that exact space Morant took the shot from previously. Unfortunately for him, Morant slips right past him to the rim for another two points.

>[!example] Guard on Guard Screening Violence
Later in the quarter, tired of abusing Brook Lopez, the Grizzlies call for 6'1 Scottie Pippen Jr. to set the ball screen, pulling Damian Lillard up with him. With Trent Jr. telegraphing over the top of the screen and Lillard in drop coverage, Morant finds the perfect pass to a slipping Pippen Jr. to score over Taurean Prince. Shout out to Jay Huff (10/20 3PT as of writing this) in the corner who is keeping the Buck's ideal rim protector out of the mix.

>[!example] Who Even Needs a Screen?
This time Brandon Clarke slips the screen before even really setting it, but it doesn't matter as long as Brook Lopez remains committed to staying in drop. Giannis gets the memo and rotates away from Jaren Jackson Jr. in the corner to help, but it's too late. Weak foul call, to me.

>[!example] Drop Again
This one starts with the usual Brook Lopez drop coverage. To his credit he guesses correctly and commits to Morant's drive, but a nice lob pass finds Edey above the rim. The guy you might expect to rotate (Prince) is wary of leaving respectable 3PT shooter Santi Aldama (11/28 3PT on the early season) in the corner. His gesture after the play leads me to think he was never supposed to be the low man in this coverage.

>[!example] Centerfield
My initial read is that Milwaukee just gets caught too low on this next one. No scheme would allow Ja Morant that much space under the screens he's been raking them across all night. No matter, Lopez is in the painted area when his man sets the screen a foot inside the three point line and has no choice but to backpeddle and hope a charging Morant settles for the midrange. Morant does not settle. With Giannis as the help defense coming from his left, he lobs it over to Edey on his right who has an easy catch and finish.

>[!example] Hedge Fun
Giannis it's your turn! With Lopez out and Antetokounmpo serving as a more mobile big, the Bucks try to flat hedge the screen by forcing Morant horizontally left rather than downhill at the basket. Morant reads this move immediately, rejects the screen (!) and has a wide open lane to the basket. Prince makes a good rotation to stop the drive, but Aldama sneaks in behind him to catch the lob.

He's very good. That's all the pick and roll I wanted to highlight, but just know he was doing whatever he wanted out there.
